# Resync: AI-Powered HWA/TWS Interface

## Overview
Resync is an AI-powered interface for HCL Workload Automation (HWA), formerly known as IBM Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS). It transforms complex TWS operations into an intuitive chat interface powered by artificial intelligence, providing real-time monitoring, status queries, and diagnostic capabilities in natural language.

## Use Cases

### 1. Job Status Inquiry
Operator queries the status of a specific job. Operator needs to know if a critical job completed successfully.

Steps:
1. Operator asks: "What is the status of job FINANCE_PAYROLL?"
2. System queries TWS API for real-time status
3. System checks knowledge graph for related information
4. System returns consolidated response

### 2. Failed Jobs Report
Operator requests list of failed jobs in the last 4 hours. Operator needs to identify and resolve recent job failures.

### 3. System Health Check
Operator requests overall system health status. Operator needs quick overview of system status.

### 4. Knowledge Graph Update
System automatically updates knowledge graph with new resolution pattern. Repeated resolution of similar issues by operators.

### 5. Agent Monitoring
Operator queries status of all agents. Operator needs to verify system components are running.

### 6. Agent Interaction
Operator directly interacts with specific agent. Operator needs detailed information from specific agent.

### 7. Real-time Monitoring
Operator requests live updates on system status. Operator needs to monitor critical job execution.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application requires the following environment variables:

```
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_admin_password
SECRET_KEY=your_very_secure_random_string_at_least_32_chars_long
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-host:6379
LLM_ENDPOINT=http://your-llm-endpoint:11434/v1
LLM_API_KEY=your_llm_api_key
TWS_HOST=your-tws-host
TWS_PORT=31111
TWS_USER=your-tws-username
TWS_PASSWORD=your-tws-password
```

- Base settings in `settings.toml`
- Environment-specific overrides in `settings.{environment}.toml`
- Environment variables with `APP_` prefix

## Connection Pooling Implementation

### Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive connection pooling optimization system for the Resync application. The implementation provides robust connection management across all system components with proper resource lifecycle management, monitoring, and graceful degradation.

### Completed Components
1. **Connection Pool Configuration**: 20+ new configuration parameters for connection pooling
2. **Core Connection Pool Manager**: Includes DatabaseConnectionPool, RedisConnectionPool, and HTTPConnectionPool
3. **Enhanced WebSocket Pool Manager**: Advanced WebSocket connection management
4. **Settings Files Configuration**: Environment-specific configurations
5. **Integration Updates**: Updates to core services to use connection pools

### Performance Characteristics
- **Database Connection Pools**: 50+ requests/second, 95th percentile <100ms
- **Redis Connection Pools**: 100+ requests/second, 95th percentile <50ms
- **HTTP Connection Pools**: 50+ requests/second, 95th percentile <200ms
- **WebSocket Connection Pools**: 1000+ concurrent connections

## Memory Bounds Implementation

### Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive memory bounds for the health_history list in the HealthCheckService to prevent unbounded growth and ensure efficient memory usage.

### Key Features
1. **Size-based cleanup**: Triggers when history exceeds configurable threshold
2. **Age-based cleanup**: Removes entries older than retention period
3. **Minimum retention**: Ensures critical history is never completely lost
4. **Batch cleanup**: Efficient removal of multiple entries at once
5. **Monitoring & Alerting**: Real-time memory usage estimation

## CQRS Pattern Implementation

### Key Implementation Details
1. **Command-Query Separation**:
   - Commands for write operations (e.g., `CreateItemCommand`)
   - Queries for read operations (e.g., `GetItemQuery`)

2. **Dispatcher Pattern**:
   - Centralized dispatching of commands/queries
   - Type-based handler resolution
   - Thread-safe execution

3. **Handler Registration**:
   - Central registry for all handlers
   - Type-safe registration
   - Easy extension for new commands/queries

4. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Container provides dispatcher instance
   - App state stores dispatcher
   - Startup event initializes handlers

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Type checking for command/query types
   - Handler registration validation
   - Graceful shutdown procedures

This implementation follows these design principles:
- Separation of concerns (commands vs queries)
- Dependency inversion (dispatcher interface)
- Open/closed principle (easy to extend)
- Single responsibility (each component has one job)
- Type safety (explicit type annotations)

The solution maintains backward compatibility with existing endpoints while introducing a clean CQRS architecture that scales well for future features.

## Coding Standards

### General Principles
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Keep functions/methods under 30 lines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer type hints
- Avoid side effects in functions

### Error Handling
- Always log exceptions with context
- Use specific exception types
- Avoid bare `except:` clauses

| Element         | Convention                  | Example                  |
|----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Functions      | `verb_noun`                | `get_job_status()`      |
| Classes        | `UpperCamelCase`           | `AgentBase`             |

## Not Implemented / Discrepancies

The following items mentioned in this document are not fully implemented in the actual codebase or have discrepancies:

1. **Technology Stack**: The document mentions "Llama3, Gemini, Qdrant, Litellm" in the technology stack, but the actual implementation uses Neo4j for the knowledge graph instead of Qdrant, and there's no specific implementation of Llama3, Gemini, or Litellm mentioned directly in the code.

2. **Specific AI Model Integration**: While the system supports AI agents and LLM integration, the specific integration with Llama3, Gemini, or Litellm as mentioned in the technology stack may not be fully implemented as described.

3. **Excel to Qdrant Knowledge Base**: The document mentions "Base de conhecimento inicial (Excel → Qdrant)", but the actual knowledge graph implementation uses Neo4j instead of Qdrant.
